ROS2swarm is available for the ROS 2 Versions 
[Dashing (dashing-dev)](https://gitlab.iti.uni-luebeck.de/ROS2/ros2swarm/-/tree/dashing-dev) and 
[Foxy (foxy-dev)](https://gitlab.iti.uni-luebeck.de/ROS2/ros2swarm/-/tree/foxy-dev). 

The swarm behavior pattern consists of movement and voting 
based [patterns](#existing-patterns). 
Basic patterns can be used by combined patterns to create more complex behaviors out of basic 
components. The behaviors are available for simulation and out of the box for several [supported robot platforms](#supported-robots). We provide [launch scripts](#launch_script_overview) and shell [scripts to start](#how-to-use) ROS2swarm.

### **How to use ROS2swarm**

ROS2swarm provides launch scripts to start the patterns in a simulation or on real robots.
The parameters of the launch scripts, such as the robot type, can be set by editing the parameter sections of the following
scripts. 

| Script                              | Function                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| start_simulation.sh                 | Start the Gazebo simulation with the desired *number of specified robots*. To start behavior execution, run start_command.sh script.                                                    |
| start_robot.sh                      | Start *one* physical robot. To start behavior execution, run the start_command.sh script.                                                                                          |
| start_command.sh                    | Starts behavior execution on *all* robots in the network. <br/>  ros2 topic pub --once /swarm_command communication_interfaces/msg/Int8Message "{data: 1}"                                                                                                             |
| scripts/add_robots_to_simulation.sh | Adds additional robots to the running Gazebo simulation. These can be of a different robot type providing an easy way to simulate heterogeneous swarms. |

<a name="supported-robots"></a>
### **Supported robot platforms**
ROS2swarm currently supports the following robot platforms out of the box:

<a name="existing-patterns"></a>
### **Existing patterns**

The following table gives an overview the current implemented patterns.
The patterns are separated into movement and voting patterns. 
Every pattern can either be a basic pattern or a combined one, which make use of one or more other patterns to create more complex behaviors.

| Pattern                      | Domain          | Type     | Simulation          | Robot              |

### **Architecture**

We give a short overview of the pattern components, the launch scripts and the packages of ROS2swarm.

<a name="components_of_a_pattern"></a>
#### **Components of a pattern**

A pattern consists of the behavior implementation itself, as well as configuration and launch files. 

| File                                                            | Function                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ros2swarm/pattern_domain/pattern_type/pattern_name.py           | The behavior logic of the pattern.                                                  |
| config/robot_type/pattern_domain/pattern_type/pattern_name.yaml | The parameter configuration for the pattern. There is one file for each robot type. |
| launch/pattern_domain/pattern_type/pattern_name.launch.py       | The launch file starting the ROS node with the parameters specified in pattern_name.yaml.|

To add a new pattern, copy the files from any existing pattern, e.g. the drive pattern, and implement the desired behavior. 
Also remember to add the files of the new pattern to the setup.py and to register the main function of the new pattern there. 
The new pattern can be started via the start_*.sh scripts with the name defined in the setup.py.

<a name="launch_script_overview"></a>
#### **Launch script overview**
The provided launch scripts help the user to start ROS2swarm and to execute the desired behaviors. There are several scripts which are chained. In this section we explain their purpose and internal call order. We provide scripts both for starting desired swarm behaviors in simulation and on the real robot. 

<a name="simulation"></a>
##### **Simulation**

For robot types TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi and TurtleBot3 Burger:

* start_simulation.sh - shell script to start up the Gazebo simulator and ROS2swarm 
  * launch_turtlebot_gazebo/launch/create_environment.launch.py - central simulation launch script which calls the other launch scripts 
    * launch_turtlebot_gazebo/launch/start_gazebo.launch.py - start the Gazebo simulator
    * launch_turtlebot_gazebo/launch_turtlebot_gazebo/add_bot_node.py - adds a Gazebo robot node for each robot
    * ros2swarm/launch/bringup_patterns.launch.py - manage the start of the pattern for each robot with its own namespace
      * ros2swarm/hardware_protection_layer.py - hardware protection layer node

      * etc. as above

For robot type Jackal UGV:
* start a roscore 
* run the rosbridge: https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge
* start the jackal simulation: https://gitlab.iti.uni-luebeck.de/plattenteich/jackal-swarm-addition  
* start_simulation.sh - with robot:=jackal

<a name="robot"></a>
##### **Real Robots**

For robot types TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi and TurtleBot3 Burger:

* start_robot.sh - shell script to start up ROS2swarm on a single robot
  * ros2swarm/bringup_robot.launch.py - central robot launch script which adds the other launch scripts to the launch description
    * ros2swarm/turtlebot3_bringup.launch.py - starts the TurtleBot3 robot nodes and launch files

For robot type Jackal:
* start_robot.sh - shell script to start up ROS2swarm on a single robot with robot:=jackal
  * does not start the jackal counterpart, only provides subscribers and publishers of the behavior pattern 

<a name="contained_packages"></a>
#### **Package Structure**

ROS2swarm consists of three ROS packages:

* ros2swarm
    * The main package containing the behavior patterns and their configuration and launch files.
* launch_turtlebot_gazebo
    * Scripts to start the Gazebo simulation
* communication_interfaces
    * Interfaces for special ROS messages used by the patterns

<a name="modified-models"></a>
### **Using the modified TurtleBot3 models**

ROS2swarm provides meshes for modified Turtlebot3 models. To use them they have to be copied to the workspace of the turtlebot3 package as described in the following. To select the standard Turtlebot3 Waffle Pi robot, use "waffle_pi" in the start scripts. To select a modified Turtlebot3 Waffle Pi version, use "waffle_pi_name_of_modification" in the start scripts. The mesh for Gazebo is then automatically selected when using the provided launch scripts. The same applies for the TurtleBot3 "burger" model.
In the following the steps to use the modified models are described.

#### LED:
1) copy the WaffelPi_Model_Extension/turtlebot3_waffle_pi_led directory to the model directory of the turtlebot3_ws 
(turtlebot3_ws/src/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/models)
2) build turtlebot3_ws
```
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws && colcon build --symlink-install
```
3) use robot selection parameter in start_*.sh 
```
robots:=waffle_pi_led
```

#### TurtleBot3 with no sensor visualisation in Gazebo
To use the TurtleBot3 Burger, replace "waffle_pi" with "burger" in the following.

1) copy
```
WaffelPi_Model_Extension/turtlebot3_waffle_pi_invisible_sensors
```
to
```
turtlebot3_ws/src/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/models
```
2) copy
```
WaffelPi_Model_Extension/turtlebot3_waffle_pi_invisible_sensors.urdf
```
to
```
turtlebot3_ws/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_description
```
3) build turtlebot3_ws
```
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws && colcon build --symlink-install
```
4) use robot selection parameter in start_*.sh 
```
robots:=waffle_pi_invisible_sensors
```
5)
```
source ~/turtlebot3_ws/install/setup.bash
```
